## 🔎 Overview  

Vanta is a **production-grade capital intelligence operating system**, not a trading bot.  
It continuously ingests heterogeneous financial and sentiment signals, enriches them in real time, and produces **conviction-ranked intelligence vectors** with explainable rationales.  

Unlike scrapers or retail scripts, Vanta fuses:  
- ⚡ **Low-latency collectors** → scrapers, API pollers, SSE listeners, darknet monitors  
- 🧩 **Entity resolution graphs** → insiders ↔ tickers ↔ wallets ↔ sentiment IDs  
- 🗂 **Dual feature stores** → offline parquet/S3 lake + online Redis cache  
- 🧠 **Multi-model ensembles** → forecasters, anomaly detectors, classifiers, graph models  
- 🔗 **Execution gateways** → equities, options, crypto (Alpaca, Tradier, CEX connectors)  
- 📜 **Replayable audit DAGs** → attribution, compliance, forensic backtesting  
- 🎭 **Persona/Dream Engine** → persona simulators, contrarian/chaos flips, reinforcement agents  

Every decision is **auditable, replayable, and attributable down to signal lineage**, enabling institutional-grade confidence in fully autonomous execution.  
---

## 🎯 Purpose  

Vanta’s mission is to deliver **real-time conviction vectors** with explainable reasoning chains across equities, derivatives, and crypto - routed through autonomous vault allocators and execution engines.  

Core objectives:  
- 🕵️ **Detect insider clusters** → SEC Form 4 & 13F activity, mapped to ticker embeddings  
- 🌐 **Surface retail cascades** → Reddit, Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord (with bot-swarm detection)  
- 🏦 **Quantify institutional footprints** → dark pools, block trades, sweep activity, volatility skews  
- ⛓ **Integrate on-chain telemetry** → whale wallets, mempool anomalies, stablecoin mint/burn  
- 🧮 **Route ranked conviction signals** → conviction vectors weighted by belief stackers, scored against historical PnL bands  
- 💰 **Enable vault-level autonomy** → conviction signals flow into vault allocators with risk caps, reinvestment curves, and auto-trading engines  

This purpose makes Vanta **more than a signal generator** - it is an **end-to-end autonomous market operator** capable of reasoning, allocating, and executing with institutional precision.  
---

## 🌐 Data Domains & Feeds  

Vanta ingests from a **multi-modal spectrum of domains**, ensuring orthogonal coverage across regulatory, social, market, macro, crypto, and telemetry layers. Each domain is routed through collectors → enrichment → entity resolution before surfacing in conviction vectors.  

- 📜 **Regulatory** → SEC Atom feeds (Form 4 insider filings, 13F institutional holdings), mapped to insider→ticker embeddings  
- 💬 **Social & Sentiment** → Reddit stealth scrapers (WSB, investing, options), Twitter/X dynamic streams, Telegram/Discord chatter with swarm/botnet detection  
- 📊 **Market Microstructure** → options sweepers, dark pool prints, block trades, order book imbalance, volatility surface skew monitoring  
- 📰 **Macro & News** → RSS aggregators, Substack/blogs, economic calendars, financial APIs, curated news sentiment engines  
- ₿ **Crypto & Alt Assets** → on-chain DEX flows, whale wallet clustering, mempool watchers, stablecoin mint/burn anomalies, staking/unstaking telemetry  
- 📡 **Telemetry & Meta-Signals** → ingestion lag monitors, drift metrics, vault compounding curves, persona simulation feedback loops  

By fusing these feeds, **Vanta transforms heterogeneous raw data into cohesive market intelligence streams**, ensuring redundancy, adversarial coverage, and low-latency alignment.By fusing these feeds, **Vanta transforms **heterogeneous raw data** into **cohesive market intelligence streams**, ensuring redundancy, adversarial coverage, and low-latency alignment.

## 🏗 System Architecture  

Vanta’s architecture is built for **real-time capital intelligence at production scale**, engineered to handle noisy heterogeneous data, preserve lineage, and drive autonomous execution with governance baked in.  

Pipeline Flow:  
Collectors → Stream Bus → Pre-Enrichment → Entity Resolution → Feature Store → Model Ensemble → Conviction Scorer → Vault Allocator → Broker Execution → Audit Harness → Replay  

### Core Components  

- **Collectors**  
  - Containerized ingestion workers for APIs, stealth scrapers, SSE sockets, and darknet monitors.  
  - Resilient to bans and obfuscation with rotating user agents, proxy pools, and retry/backoff strategies.  
  - Includes specialized modules:  
    - `reddit_stealth.py` (Reddit WSB + investing chatter with swarm detection)  
    - `sec_scraper.py` (SEC Atom Form 4/13F)  
    - `crypto_signals.py` (DEX flows, mempool spikes, whale wallets)  

- **Stream Bus**  
  - Kafka/Redis Streams backbone with **partition isolation per domain** (regulatory, sentiment, crypto).  
  - Ensures **low-latency fan-out** to enrichment and feature pipelines.  
  - Backpressure-aware with replay offsets for deterministic recovery.  

- **Pre-Enrichment**  
  - Deduplication, normalization, and temporal alignment across feeds.  
  - Embeds metadata for model provenance (collector ID, source lag, normalization checksum).  
  - Integrates **bot-swarm detection** for sentiment streams.  

- **Entity Resolution**  
  - Canonical graph aligning insiders ↔ tickers ↔ wallets ↔ sentiment IDs.  
  - Backed by **Neo4j embeddings** and reinforcement from persona simulators.  
  - Enables **cross-domain linkage** (e.g., insider filing linked to crypto wallet flows).  

- **Feature Store**  
  - **Dual-tier design:**  
    - Offline → Parquet/S3 for backtesting, rolling aggregates.  
    - Online → Redis for sub-10ms feature retrieval at inference.  
  - Supports temporal joins, rolling windows, and vault overlays.  

- **Model Ensemble**  
  - DAG orchestration spanning anomaly detectors, forecasters, classifiers, and graph embeddings.  
  - Persona simulators feed reinforcement signals into the stack (e.g., risk-averse vs contrarian weights).  
  - Supports **parallel shadow/live inference** for model governance.  

- **Conviction Scorer**  
  - Weighted belief stacker producing ranked conviction vectors.  
  - Includes explainability metadata: SHAP/LIME overlays + GPT rationales.  
  - Conviction vectors route into vault allocators and execution routers.  

- **Vault Allocator**  
  - Converts conviction vectors into **capital allocation JSONs** (`vault.json`, `vault_overlay.json`).  
  - Supports **compounding logic, reinvestment curves, stop-loss overlays**, and persona biases.  
  - Backtests vault performance across historical replay windows.  

- **Execution Router**  
  - Broker API adapters: Alpaca (equities/options), Tradier (retail options), CEX/DEX connectors.  
  - Risk-governed execution with conviction thresholds + persona overrides.  
  - Supports **shadow-to-live transitions** with rollback hooks.  

- **Audit DAGs**  
  - Append-only inference DAGs capturing ingestion → transformations → features → model outputs → conviction scores → allocations → trades.  
  - Fully replayable for compliance, attribution, and debugging.  
  - Exportable to **dashboards + sanitized reporting**.  

### Orchestration Across Nodes  

- **Alpha Node** → Orchestration + global memory (assistant, trackers, vault overlays).  
- **Markets Node** → Ingestion + reflection (collectors, entity resolution, ensembles).  
- **Executor Node** → Trade execution + broker integrations.  
- **Persona/Dream Layer** → Parallel reinforcement (risk-averse, contrarian, chaos sims) feeding conviction stack.  

By design, Vanta ensures that every **collector, transformation, and decision is traceable** — making it not just a streaming system, but a **governed capital OS**.    

---

## 🤖 Model Layer  

The **Model Layer** is the reasoning core of Vanta OS, transforming raw signals into **conviction-ranked intelligence vectors**. It is architected as a **multi-model ensemble stack** with explainability and persona reinforcement baked in.  

### Subsystems  

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  - IsolationForest for multi-variate outlier scoring.  
  - Rolling z-score monitors for short-horizon market deviations.  
  - Bayesian changepoint detection for structural breaks in time series (e.g., regime shifts).  
  - Persona-weighted reinforcement: e.g., risk-averse persona amplifies anomaly flags, contrarian suppresses them.  

- **Forecasting**  
  - **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT):** multi-horizon financial forecasting.  
  - **DeepAR:** probabilistic sequence models for options sweeps and order flow.  
  - **Prophet:** macro / seasonal drivers (earnings cycles, Fed announcements).  
  - Shadow/live dual inference pipelines ensure drift-resistant forecasts.  

- **Classification**  
  - **XGBoost & LightGBM classifiers** for directional probabilities (upside/downside in equities/options).  
  - Ensemble classifiers for **prop hit probability** in derivative strategies.  
  - Persona overlays inject different thresholds (e.g., aggressive personas lower confidence cutoffs).  

- **Graph Models**  
  - **Neo4j graph embeddings** link insiders → tickers → wallets → chatter IDs.  
  - Detects **clusters of influence** (e.g., insider filings co-occurring with Reddit surges and crypto wallet flows).  
  - Supports path queries for hybrid reasoning: *“Is this signal driven by insiders, retail, or coordinated?”*  

- **Meta-Belief Stacker**  
  - Core ensemble aggregator combining forecasts, anomalies, classifiers, and graph signals.  
  - Uses weighted voting + persona reinforcement to construct conviction vectors.  
  - Supports **flip mode** (parallel evaluation of alternative paths → “what if” scenarios).  
  - Produces both **conviction score** and **reason vector** (explainable rationale chain).  

### Conviction Vector Schema  

Every inference cycle outputs a **conviction vector**, which carries scores, reasons, and routing metadata.  

| signal_id | conviction_score | reason_vector | contributing_models | persona_overrides | TTL | routing_tags |

- **signal_id:** unique UUID from collector layer.  
- **conviction_score:** weighted probability, 0–1.  
- **reason_vector:** concatenated explanations (e.g., “SEC Form 4 + Dark Pool Sweep + Retail Surge”).  
- **contributing_models:** ensemble contributors and their weights.  
- **persona_overrides:** adjustments from persona sims (risk-averse, aggressive, contrarian).  
- **TTL:** signal half-life for decay and pruning.  
- **routing_tags:** directs output to vault allocators, dashboards, or executors.  

The **Model Layer** ensures that Vanta is not just ingesting data but **reasoning about it** - producing **transparent, persona-aware conviction outputs** ready for allocation and execution.  

---
## ⚙️ Model Ops  

The **Model Ops layer** governs the lifecycle, monitoring, and explainability of all models in Vanta OS. It ensures that every signal is **traceable, auditable, and continuously retrained** for resilience in adversarial markets.  

### Subsystems  

- **Registry**  
  - **MLflow-backed registry** with lineage, hyperparameter storage, and experiment tracking.  
  - Each model version tagged with data slice, persona overlays, and drift metrics.  
  - Registry links directly to `/opt/vanta/tools/vault_alignment.py` for vault-aware promotion.  

- **Retraining**  
  - **Rolling-window retrains** across equities, options, and crypto domains.  
  - **Shadow→live pipeline:** new models first run in shadow mode, producing metrics alongside live production signals.  
  - Promotion only if **PnL attribution** > baseline and **precision@5** sustained.  

- **CI/CD**  
  - **GitOps pipelines** for model deployment, triggered by drift alarms or scheduled retrains.  
  - Canary deployments on **Executor node** with rollback hooks.  
  - Integration with persona simulators for scenario stress tests before release.  

- **Monitoring**  
  - Drift detection via **PSI (Population Stability Index)** and **KL divergence**.  
  - **Lag dashboards** track ingestion → vector latency across nodes.  
  - **Feature SLOs:** alerts when enrichment or entity resolution pipelines exceed thresholds.  

- **Explainability**  
  - **SHAP/LIME overlays** tied to every conviction vector, showing feature contributions.  
  - **GPT rationale generator** produces human-readable justifications for dashboards and audits.  
  - Persona-aware explanations: *“Risk-averse persona flagged insider cluster + volatility skew.”*  

- **Backtesting & Replay**  
  - **Multi-year replay harness** for testing new models against historical vault data.  
  - **PnL attribution bundles** provide model-level contribution breakdowns.  
  - Replay DAGs are append-only, ensuring compliance and reproducibility.  

### Outputs  

- **Model health dashboards** (latency, drift, retrain cadence).  
- **Audit trails** mapping every signal → model version → conviction vector → execution.  
- **Compliance packs** exportable for FINRA/SEC reviews.  

The Model Ops layer guarantees that Vanta’s models are **not static scripts** but **living, continuously evolving systems**, aligned with capital allocation and regulatory-grade auditability.

## 🔐 Security & Governance  

Vanta OS is designed for **institution-grade resilience**, with layered controls across orchestration, reflection, and execution nodes. Security and governance are not add-ons — they are **core primitives**.  

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- **Alpha Node** → orchestration, assistant memory, and tracker management.  
- **Markets Node** → ingestion, reflection, scoring.  
- **Executor Node** → live trading execution + broker integration.  
- Each role is scoped at the node level with **least-privilege enforcement**.  

### Encryption & Secrets Management  
- **TLS 1.3 mutual authentication** across all inter-node traffic.  
- **HashiCorp Vault** (or equivalent) for secrets distribution.  
- **Field-level encryption** for sensitive data (e.g., PHI/PII in health variants, account keys).  

### Auditability & Compliance  
- **Append-only logs** for every signal, score, and trade.  
- **Replayable DAGs** → entire inference + execution path can be reconstructed.  
- **Immutable vaults** (JSON memory structures) with overlays for audit trails.  
- Compliance alignment:  
  - **FINRA/SEC** for equities and options.  
  - **Jurisdictional gaming regulations** for betting overlays.  
  - **Future-state HIPAA** for health data (inherited from Aegis).  

### Governance Overlays  
- **Conviction Thresholds** → dynamic kill-switches and stop-loss governance.  
- **Persona Balancing** → allocations automatically adjusted across risk-averse, contrarian, and aggressive personas.  
- **Vault Allocation Logic** → ensures capital limits per signal, per cycle.  
- **Shadow Deployments** → strategies are tested in replay before going live.  

### Enterprise-Grade Controls  
- **99.9% SLA enforcement** with monitoring of ingestion/execution liveness.  
- **Isolation by containerization** (per module sandboxing).  
- **Node failover orchestration** → continuity even if Markets or Executor is unavailable.  

---

**Why This Matters:**  
Vanta’s governance framework ensures that **capital can be loaned, allocated, and risk-managed automatically** without requiring manual oversight. Investors and operators can verify every decision post-hoc, guaranteeing **trustworthy autonomy** in high-stakes environments.  

---

## 💰 Vaults & Capital Allocation
- **Vault Engine:** JSON vaults (`vault.json`, `vault_overlay.json`) govern allocations  
- **Allocation Logic:** conviction vectors → proportional or banded splits  
- **Auto-Trading:** `autotrade_queue.json` → executed by Executor node with governance  
- **Persona Profiles:** risk-averse, contrarian, aggressive overlays  
- **Loan Mode:** exports external capital with isolated vaults + guardrails  
- **Compounding:** realized PnL reinvested automatically into growth vaults
