## Why VANTA OS Is Different

VANTA OS is not another trading bot or signal feed.  
It is a **capital intelligence operating system** engineered to make autonomous reasoning, vault allocation, and live execution **trustworthy at scale**.  

What sets it apart:

- **Closed-Loop Autonomy**  
  Every cycle is end-to-end: ingest ‚Üí enrich ‚Üí reason ‚Üí allocate ‚Üí execute ‚Üí audit ‚Üí retrain.  
  No external ‚Äúhuman in the loop‚Äù required - but every decision is transparent and replayable.

- **Vaults as First-Class Primitives**  
  Signals don‚Äôt just rank. They **flow into vault allocators** that encode risk rails, persona overlays, and compounding logic.  
  Vaults are deterministic state machines, not black-box accounts.

- **Persona-Reinforced Intelligence**  
  The OS embeds named personas (*Athena*, *Apollo*, *Nemesis*) that bias reasoning modes (risk-averse, aggressive, contrarian).  
  These personas act as reinforcement layers, not cosmetic labels.

- **Replayable Audit DAGs**  
  Every signal, allocation, and trade is logged in an append-only DAG.  
  Investigators can reconstruct the exact chain of reasoning and execution at any timestamp.

- **Cross-Domain Ingestion**  
  Market data, on-chain telemetry, insider filings, and sentiment streams are fused in real time.  
  The OS runs on a **heterogeneous stream bus** with backpressure control and replay offsets.

- **Shadow ‚Üí Live Governance**  
  Models and strategies run in parallel shadow/live pipelines.  
  Nothing is promoted to live execution until attribution exceeds baselines.  
  Drift alarms (<24h) guarantee resilience in adversarial markets.

- **Aligned Incentives**  
  Unlike retail feeds, the OS is not monetized by selling tickers.  
  It is designed so performance fees, vault growth, and compounding curves align system incentives with capital outcomes.

---

In short:  
VANTA OS is **the first governed, replayable, persona-reinforced capital OS**, not a bot or a signal seller.  
It encodes **how capital should think, act, and govern itself** - in real time, across rails, without trust gaps.

## üîé Overview  

Vanta is a **production-grade capital intelligence operating system**, not a trading bot.  
It continuously ingests heterogeneous financial and sentiment signals, enriches them in real time, and produces **conviction-ranked intelligence vectors** with explainable rationales.  

Unlike scrapers or retail scripts, Vanta fuses:  
- ‚ö° **Low-latency collectors** ‚Üí scrapers, API pollers, SSE listeners, darknet monitors  
- üß© **Entity resolution graphs** ‚Üí insiders ‚Üî tickers ‚Üî wallets ‚Üî sentiment IDs  
- üóÇ **Dual feature stores** ‚Üí offline parquet/S3 lake + online Redis cache  
- üß† **Multi-model ensembles** ‚Üí forecasters, anomaly detectors, classifiers, graph models  
- üîó **Execution gateways** ‚Üí equities, options, crypto (Alpaca, Tradier, CEX connectors)  
- üìú **Replayable audit DAGs** ‚Üí attribution, compliance, forensic backtesting  
- üé≠ **Persona/Dream Engine** ‚Üí persona simulators, contrarian/chaos flips, reinforcement agents  

Every decision is auditable, replayable, and attributable down to signal lineage, enabling institutional-grade confidence in fully autonomous execution.

---

## üéØ Purpose  

Vanta‚Äôs mission is to deliver **real-time conviction vectors** with explainable reasoning chains across equities, derivatives, and crypto - routed through autonomous vault allocators and execution engines.  

Core objectives:  
- üïµÔ∏è **Detect insider clusters** ‚Üí SEC Form 4 & 13F activity, mapped to ticker embeddings  
- üåê **Surface retail cascades** ‚Üí Reddit, Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord (with bot-swarm detection)  
- üè¶ **Quantify institutional footprints** ‚Üí dark pools, block trades, sweep activity, volatility skews  
- ‚õì **Integrate on-chain telemetry** ‚Üí whale wallets, mempool anomalies, stablecoin mint/burn  
- üßÆ **Route ranked conviction signals** ‚Üí conviction vectors weighted by belief stackers, scored against historical PnL bands  
- üí∞ **Enable vault-level autonomy** ‚Üí conviction signals flow into vault allocators with risk caps, reinvestment curves, and auto-trading engines  

This purpose makes Vanta **more than a signal generator** - it is an **end-to-end autonomous market operator** capable of reasoning, allocating, and executing with institutional precision.  

---

## üåê Data Domains & Feeds  

Vanta ingests from a **multi-modal spectrum of domains**, ensuring orthogonal coverage across regulatory, social, market, macro, crypto, and telemetry layers. Each domain is routed through collectors ‚Üí enrichment ‚Üí entity resolution before surfacing in conviction vectors.  

- üìú **Regulatory** ‚Üí SEC Atom feeds (Form 4 insider filings, 13F institutional holdings), mapped to insider‚Üíticker embeddings  
- üí¨ **Social & Sentiment** ‚Üí Reddit stealth scrapers (WSB, investing, options), Twitter/X dynamic streams, Telegram/Discord chatter with swarm/botnet detection  
- üìä **Market Microstructure** ‚Üí options sweepers, dark pool prints, block trades, order book imbalance, volatility surface skew monitoring  
- üì∞ **Macro & News** ‚Üí RSS aggregators, Substack/blogs, economic calendars, financial APIs, curated news sentiment engines  
- ‚Çø **Crypto & Alt Assets** ‚Üí on-chain DEX flows, whale wallet clustering, mempool watchers, stablecoin mint/burn anomalies, staking/unstaking telemetry  
- üì° **Telemetry & Meta-Signals** ‚Üí ingestion lag monitors, drift metrics, vault compounding curves, persona simulation feedback loops  

By fusing these feeds, **Vanta transforms heterogeneous raw data into cohesive market intelligence streams**, ensuring redundancy, adversarial coverage, and low-latency alignment.By fusing these feeds, **Vanta transforms **heterogeneous raw data** into **cohesive market intelligence streams**, ensuring redundancy, adversarial coverage, and low-latency alignment.

---

## ü§ñ Model Layer  

The **Model Layer** is the reasoning core of Vanta OS, transforming raw signals into **conviction-ranked intelligence vectors**. It is architected as a **multi-model ensemble stack** with explainability and persona reinforcement baked in.  

### Subsystems  

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  - IsolationForest for multi-variate outlier scoring.  
  - Rolling z-score monitors for short-horizon market deviations.  
  - Bayesian changepoint detection for structural breaks in time series (e.g., regime shifts).  
  - Persona-weighted reinforcement: e.g., risk-averse persona amplifies anomaly flags, contrarian suppresses them.  

- **Forecasting**  
  - **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT):** multi-horizon financial forecasting.  
  - **DeepAR:** probabilistic sequence models for options sweeps and order flow.  
  - **Prophet:** macro / seasonal drivers (earnings cycles, Fed announcements).  
  - Shadow/live dual inference pipelines ensure drift-resistant forecasts.  

- **Classification**  
  - **XGBoost & LightGBM classifiers** for directional probabilities (upside/downside in equities/options).  
  - Ensemble classifiers for **prop hit probability** in derivative strategies.  
  - Persona overlays inject different thresholds (e.g., aggressive personas lower confidence cutoffs).  

- **Graph Models**  
  - **Neo4j graph embeddings** link insiders ‚Üí tickers ‚Üí wallets ‚Üí chatter IDs.  
  - Detects **clusters of influence** (e.g., insider filings co-occurring with Reddit surges and crypto wallet flows).  
  - Supports path queries for hybrid reasoning: *‚ÄúIs this signal driven by insiders, retail, or coordinated?‚Äù*  

- **Meta-Belief Stacker**  
  - Core ensemble aggregator combining forecasts, anomalies, classifiers, and graph signals.  
  - Uses weighted voting + persona reinforcement to construct conviction vectors.  
  - Supports **flip mode** (parallel evaluation of alternative paths ‚Üí ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios).  
  - Produces both **conviction score** and **reason vector** (explainable rationale chain).  

### Conviction Vector Schema  

Every inference cycle outputs a **conviction vector**, which carries scores, reasons, and routing metadata.  

| signal_id | conviction_score | reason_vector | contributing_models | persona_overrides | TTL | routing_tags |

- **signal_id:** unique UUID from collector layer.  
- **conviction_score:** weighted probability, 0‚Äì1.  
- **reason_vector:** concatenated explanations (e.g., ‚ÄúSEC Form 4 + Dark Pool Sweep + Retail Surge‚Äù).  
- **contributing_models:** ensemble contributors and their weights.  
- **persona_overrides:** adjustments from persona sims (risk-averse, aggressive, contrarian).  
- **TTL:** signal half-life for decay and pruning.  
- **routing_tags:** directs output to vault allocators, dashboards, or executors.  

The **Model Layer** ensures that Vanta is not just ingesting data but **reasoning about it** - producing **transparent, persona-aware conviction outputs** ready for allocation and execution.  

---
## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Ops  

The **Model Ops layer** governs the lifecycle, monitoring, and explainability of all models in Vanta OS. It ensures that every signal is **traceable, auditable, and continuously retrained** for resilience in adversarial markets.  

### Subsystems  

- **Registry**  
  - **MLflow-backed registry** with lineage, hyperparameter storage, and experiment tracking.  
  - Each model version tagged with data slice, persona overlays, and drift metrics.  
  - Registry links directly to `/opt/vanta/tools/vault_alignment.py` for vault-aware promotion.  

- **Retraining**  
  - **Rolling-window retrains** across equities, options, and crypto domains.  
  - **Shadow‚Üílive pipeline:** new models first run in shadow mode, producing metrics alongside live production signals.  
  - Promotion only if **PnL attribution** > baseline and **precision@5** sustained.  

- **CI/CD**  
  - **GitOps pipelines** for model deployment, triggered by drift alarms or scheduled retrains.  
  - Canary deployments on **Executor node** with rollback hooks.  
  - Integration with persona simulators for scenario stress tests before release.  

- **Monitoring**  
  - Drift detection via **PSI (Population Stability Index)** and **KL divergence**.  
  - **Lag dashboards** track ingestion ‚Üí vector latency across nodes.  
  - **Feature SLOs:** alerts when enrichment or entity resolution pipelines exceed thresholds.  

- **Explainability**  
  - **SHAP/LIME overlays** tied to every conviction vector, showing feature contributions.  
  - **GPT rationale generator** produces human-readable justifications for dashboards and audits.  
  - Persona-aware explanations: *‚ÄúRisk-averse persona flagged insider cluster + volatility skew.‚Äù*  

- **Backtesting & Replay**  
  - **Multi-year replay harness** for testing new models against historical vault data.  
  - **PnL attribution bundles** provide model-level contribution breakdowns.  
  - Replay DAGs are append-only, ensuring compliance and reproducibility.  

### Outputs  

- **Model health dashboards** (latency, drift, retrain cadence).  
- **Audit trails** mapping every signal ‚Üí model version ‚Üí conviction vector ‚Üí execution.  
- **Compliance packs** exportable for FINRA/SEC reviews.  

The Model Ops layer guarantees that Vanta‚Äôs models are **not static scripts** but **living, continuously evolving systems**, aligned with capital allocation and regulatory-grade auditability.

- **Markets Node** ‚Üí ingestion, reflection, scoring.  
- **Executor Node** ‚Üí live trading execution + broker integration.  
- Each role is scoped at the node level with **least-privilege enforcement**.  

### Encryption & Secrets Management  
- **TLS 1.3 mutual authentication** across all inter-node traffic.  
- **HashiCorp Vault** (or equivalent) for secrets distribution.  
- **Field-level encryption** for sensitive data (e.g., PHI/PII in health variants, account keys).  

### Auditability & Compliance  
- **Append-only logs** for every signal, score, and trade.  
- **Replayable DAGs** ‚Üí entire inference + execution path can be reconstructed.  
- **Immutable vaults** (JSON memory structures) with overlays for audit trails.  
- Compliance alignment:  
  - **FINRA/SEC** for equities and options.  
  - **Jurisdictional gaming regulations** for betting overlays.  
  - **Future-state HIPAA** for health data (inherited from Aegis).  

### Governance Overlays  
- **Conviction Thresholds** ‚Üí dynamic kill-switches and stop-loss governance.  
- **Persona Balancing** ‚Üí allocations automatically adjusted across risk-averse, contrarian, and aggressive personas.

- **Node failover orchestration** ‚Üí continuity even if Markets or Executor is unavailable.  

---

**Why This Matters:**  
Vanta‚Äôs governance framework ensures that **capital can be loaned, allocated, and risk-managed automatically** without requiring manual oversight. Investors and operators can verify every decision post-hoc, guaranteeing **trustworthy autonomy** in high-stakes environments.  

---

## üí∞ Vaults & Capital Allocation
- **Vault Engine:** JSON vaults (`vault.json`, `vault_overlay.json`) govern allocations  
- **Allocation Logic:** conviction vectors ‚Üí proportional or banded splits  
- **Auto-Trading:** `autotrade_queue.json` ‚Üí executed by Executor node with governance  
- **Persona Profiles:** risk-averse, contrarian, aggressive overlays  
- **Loan Mode:** exports external capital with isolated vaults + guardrails  
- **Compounding:** realized PnL reinvested automatically into growth vaults  

---

## ‚ö° Cost & Resource Disruption

VANTA OS is not another ‚Äúsignal bot.‚Äù It‚Äôs an **autonomous capital intelligence stack** that replaces entire workflows, teams, and vendor stacks that hedge funds and trading shops currently depend on.

### üö´ Human Resource Savings
Traditional funds require:
- **10+ Quants** - for signal research, alpha testing, factor modeling.
- **5+ Data Engineers** - to build ingestion pipelines, wrangle APIs, maintain scrapers.
- **3‚Äì4 Infra/SREs** - to manage clusters, databases, feature stores, job schedulers.
- **2 Execution Engineers** - to manage order routing, broker integrations, slippage control.
- **2 Ops/Compliance Officers** - to reconcile trades, generate daily reports, audit logs.

VANTA collapses all of this into a **deterministic, replayable OS**:
- **Signals harvested automatically** from social, filings, sentiment, options flow.
- **Feature stores + model loops** maintained in-memory, refreshed continuously.
- **Allocations + mirroring** run 24/7 without human intervention.
- **PnL, audit logs, and compliance hooks** are generated automatically and immutably.

> ‚öñÔ∏è One autonomous stack = **~20 FTEs eliminated** while running faster and more reliably.

---

### üí∞ Vendor License Disruption
Legacy shops spend millions annually on vendor feeds & tooling:
- Bloomberg / FactSet terminals ‚Üí replaced with **scrapers, APIs, & on-chain data ingestion**.
- Backtesting software ‚Üí replaced with **VANTA‚Äôs continuous replay engine**.
- MLOps platforms (Databricks, Sagemaker) ‚Üí replaced with **self-contained feature stores + registries**.
- Risk dashboards ‚Üí replaced with **PnL + vault overlays + auto-reconciliation logs**.

> **Result:** $3‚Äì5M annual vendor savings per desk.

---

### ‚è± Time Saved
- Backtests that take days/weeks in legacy pipelines ‚Üí **minutes with replayable vault overlays**.
- Manual compliance reporting (hours per cycle) ‚Üí **instant immutable JSONL logs**.
- Drift & anomaly detection ‚Üí **continuous monitors** with zero human babysitting.

---

### ‚úÖ What VANTA Does Better
1. **Autonomous:** No analyst babysitting, no ops tickets. Capital runs itself.
2. **Replayable:** Every signal ‚Üí allocation ‚Üí execution can be re-run exactly (audit-safe).
3. **Cross-Rail:** Treats fiat, crypto, and stablecoins as one continuous canvas.
4. **Transparent:** Followers see **PnL vs fees** side-by-side, real-time.
5. **Scalable:** 1 vault ‚Üí 1,000 mirrored accounts with deterministic child orders.

---

> üß† **Summary:** Instead of 20 people + 5 vendors + $5M/year in overhead,  
VANTA OS runs as one **autonomous capital brain** - live, explainable, and infinitely scalable.

## üöÄ Roadmap
- Expand on-chain crypto ingestion  
- Reinforcement-learning agents for strat refinement  
- Next.js dashboards with conviction heatmaps  
- Federated retraining pipelines for scaling  
- Persona-aware reasoning (flip mode, risk-balancing personas)

## üèÅ Final Notes
This README is not a whitepaper - it maps directly to deployed infrastructure running across Alpha, Markets, and Executor.  
Every collector, scorer, and vault exists as a Python module with live memory and logs.  

Vanta is a **closed-loop autonomous OS:**  
Harvest ‚Üí Enrich ‚Üí Reason ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Audit ‚Üí Retrain

## üîí Internal Repositories (Private)

This public README showcases the architecture and design of **VANTA OS**,  
but the production system spans several private repositories.  
These remain private to protect proprietary IP, deployment configs, and trading strategies.  

- **vanta-config** ‚Üí Deployment orchestration, environment configs, secrets management.  
- **vanta-modules** ‚Üí Core ingestion, feature engineering, conviction scoring, and trade execution modules.  
- **vanta-dashboards** ‚Üí Internal Next.js dashboards for live monitoring, conviction heatmaps, and PnL reporting.  
- **vanta-simulations** ‚Üí Backtesting harnesses, replay engines, reinforcement-learning experiments.  
- **vanta-assistant** ‚Üí Memory-aware operator assistant for orchestration, debugging, and human-in-the-loop interaction.  

Each private repo maps directly to sections described above  
(see **README ‚Üî Server Mapping**).  
Together, these repos form the full **Autonomous Capital Intelligence Stack**  
operating across **Alpha, Markets, and Executor nodes**.
