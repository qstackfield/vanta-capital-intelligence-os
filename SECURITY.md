# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
VANTA OS is currently pre-release. Security patches are managed internally.  
Public bug reporting for vulnerabilities is not enabled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue:
- **Do not** create a public GitHub issue.  
- Instead, contact the maintainer directly via LinkedIn or GitHub profile.

We take security and compliance seriously. All vulnerability disclosures will be triaged, logged, and addressed systematically.
